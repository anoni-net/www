title: COSCUP 2026 Anonymity Networks Community track
description: The Anonymity Networks Community (anoni.net) runs a two-day community track at COSCUP 2026 (Aug 8–9, NTUST, Taipei) — talks and workshops on Tor, Tails, OONI, browser tracking, campus Tor nodes, data-privacy rights, a personal privacy guide, and anonymous payments, including a session co-organized with ETHTaipei.

Journalists need to protect sources, civil-society groups need to protect members and donors, developers want to know whether the tools in their hands actually hold up against surveillance, and ordinary people rattled by scam texts or ad tracking just want a little control back. Under spreading censorship and monitoring, these needs land on the same set of risks: traffic can be intercepted, identities can be traced, and the timing and amount of a single transfer can reconstruct an entire web of relationships — sometimes exposing an organization's member list and money flow without anyone noticing.

The **Anonymity Networks Community (anoni.net)** brings a year of hands-on work with **Tor**, **Tails**, **OONI**, personal privacy, and anonymous payments to the open-source floor of COSCUP 2026. The two days run from how the internet and censorship work, through real-world open-source privacy tools, campus Tor nodes, browser tracking, and data-privacy rights, to an anonymous-payments session co-organized with ETHTaipei. Whether you came looking for tools you can use right away or want to contribute to open-source projects, there is a session for you.

!!! tip "Free entry, no registration — you can attend anonymously"

    COSCUP is free and the community track needs no advance sign-up: just walk into the room. For a community that promotes anonymity, attending can itself be anonymous — you leave no personal details behind to sit in on a talk. If you are looking for privacy or anonymity solutions, come straight to `TR-510` (the Aug 8 afternoon anonymous-payments session is in `TR-511`), pick the sessions that fit you from this rich and varied program, and feel free to chat with speakers and community members between talks.

!!! tip "Where to start, by who you are"

    - **Newsrooms and independent journalists**: "Real-world open-source privacy tools" (Aug 8 morning) walks through the secure intake channels, metadata scrubbing, and isolation tools journalists actually use, paired with "Threat models and metadata 101". On Aug 9 afternoon, "Browser tracking, anti-tracking strategies" unpacks how your everyday browser can leak who you've contacted, and "After the health-insurance database case" and "Privacy guide 2026" extend into data-privacy rights and responding to legal data requests. Further reading: [protecting journalistic sources](docs:scenarios/journalist/).
    - **Civil-society groups and NGOs**: the four Aug 8 morning primers map closely to organizational realities, and "Real-world open-source privacy tools" surveys the encrypted messaging, collaboration, and leak-intake tools civil-society groups and NGOs rely on, while "Privacy guide 2026" covers preparing for legal data requests. The Aug 8 morning talk on anonymous eligibility verification covers how a beneficiary or a whistleblower can prove they qualify without leaving identifying data behind. To weigh anonymous donation channels, the Aug 8 afternoon ETHTaipei session's "I don't launder money — so why understand anonymous payments?" is the plain-language entry point, with no crypto background needed.
    - **Open-source and tech community**: Aug 9 is the most technical — OpenWRT, the NTNU Tor node, and browser-fingerprint research are all hands-on. The Aug 8 afternoon zero-knowledge Citizen Digital Certificate work, privacy-preserving KYC, and stealth addresses are the meatiest protocol-level content. To contribute, see [how to contribute](docs:community/how-to-contribute/).
    - Feel free to bring colleagues along.

## <i data-icon="handshake"></i> Cross-community collaboration: Anonymity Networks Community × ETHTaipei { #cross-community }

This year the community is partnering with [ETHTaipei](https://ethtaipei.org/) (the Taipei Ethereum Community) on programming. The Aug 8 afternoon "Anonymous Payments" session puts people who care about digital rights and blockchain developers in the same room: NGOs and journalists can learn the privacy risks of donations and money flows, while developers get protocol-level zero-knowledge proofs and stealth-address implementations. Application-oriented and introductory talks sit in the Anonymity Networks Community track; technical and protocol-level talks may move to the ETHTaipei blockchain track (see the [joint review arrangement](/events/coscup-2026-cfp/#anoni-netxETHTaipei)). Attendees are welcome to move between the two tracks.
